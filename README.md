# Fullstack Social Network
## Here is a plan:
- make maintained project with test, typescript, linters: 
- going to use `mongo` + `express` + `react` (MERN) to make fullstack app with restful api
- Going to do 2 build modes: production && development
- Live chat on `websockets` soon...

- this is my first time using `babel`, `jest`, `react-testing-library`, `express` with `typescript` and first time with my own ts config
