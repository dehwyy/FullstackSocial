## Here is a plan:

- make maintainable project with test, typescript, linters:
- going to use `mongo` + `express` + `react` to make fullstack app
- Going to do 2 build modes: production && development

  - yesterday I was struggling with vite and babel; Idk why, but they just don't want to work together: Vite can do everything by himself and babel can do everything by himself, but not bothüíÄüíÄ; After 5 hours I gave up, but I'll be back üòé(maybe just going to setup esbuild or webpack, time will tell); Also, I sometimes hate prettier cuz of its strange line breaking, like I've 2 arg in func and their summary length is 10, and prettier just leave each arg on new line, thus code becomes unreadableüòê
